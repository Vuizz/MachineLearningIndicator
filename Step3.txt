Rule-based trading using decision trees:

The buy/sell signals generated by the neural network are used as inputs to a decision tree model. The decision tree model uses a set of rules to determine when to execute a trade. For example, the decision tree may have rules such as "Buy if the neural network outputs a 'Buy' signal and the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average".

Decision trees can be built using tools such as Scikit-learn in Python. The model can be trained using historical data to optimize its performance, and can be further refined through backtesting and fine-tuning

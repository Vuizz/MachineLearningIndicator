Pattern recognition using neural networks:
The next step is to use a neural network to identify patterns and generate trading signals. The neural network can be trained on historical data to recognize patterns such as trends, chart patterns, and other technical indicators. The output of the neural network is a set of buy/sell signals based on the identified patterns.

There are different types of neural networks that can be used for pattern recognition, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The neural network can be trained using backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms to optimize its performance
